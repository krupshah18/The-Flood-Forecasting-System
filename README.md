# Introduction 
One of the reasons for floods as assessed by the government is high intensity rainfall in a short duration of time. A machine learning model will help predict floods and issue warnings to the government as well as the citizens. This would help the government save a significant amount of money in rescue operations and the loss of life can be reduced exceptionally. The different districts of Bihar and Orissa have been considered for the implementation of the project. The dataset contains attributes such as rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature, cloud cover, etc. for a period of 20 years starting from 1992 to 2002. Using Decision Tree Algorithm, we have obtained an accuracy of 94%. An application will be built to notify citizens and the government of an incoming flood. If it is predicted that a flood will happen, then the citizens  will be asked to vacate the area and move to a higher place.

# Objective
• To predict the occurrence of floods based on comparison of real-time data and the
historical data.
• To develop and design a flood detection system based on Machine Learning algorithms
and techniques.
• To send alerts of an incoming flood to the citizens of that particular area to help save
their lives.
• To help save the government money on relocation and rescue operations in the
aftermath of a devastating flood.
• To reduce the errors in predictions of existing flood detection systems.
